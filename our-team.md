| **Dr. Sara El-Gebali, Founder** |
| I am a Research Data Management Team Leader supporting the Scientific Infrastructures unit at the Max DelbruÌˆck Center for Molecular Medicine \(MDC\). Before joining the MDC, I was a scientific database curator at the European Molecular Biology Laboratories \(EMBL\)-EBI and EMBO. During my time there, I gained comprehensive knowledge in data analysis, metadata extraction and description, data repositories, journal publishing requirements, open science data sharing practices and FAIR data principles. Prior to that, I gained my PhD from the University of Bern,Switzerland where I studied the role of amino acid transporters in colon cancer progression. I am a strong advocate for community building and the promotion of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields |
