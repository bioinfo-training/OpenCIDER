# Quick guide

Question 1

I want to analyse my data but the software only works on specific platforms, what are the alternatives? // My institute can not afford the license, any open source alternatives?// This website/tool is not available in my country, any alternatives?  


* * If you are struggling to find alternatives that work on your platform, please [check our list of tools available](https://selgebali.gitbook.io/opencider/advice-and-tools/checklists-and-info/tools-and-computational-infrastructure).

Question 2

I would like to teach my students how to use software X, I learnt to use it in high computing environments, how do I adapt it? // This is how we do computational training in my country/institute/field without relying on internet connection.  


Here are some guides that can help you adapt your teaching practices:

* * Have a look at [our Materials and Methods section](https://selgebali.gitbook.io/opencider/advice-and-tools/checklists-and-info/materials-and-methods).

Question 3

How can I collaborate and send/receive data from international institutes?  


Question 4

I am creating a software, what should I take into consideration for inclusive design? i.e. use on multiple platforms, doesn’t require any/too heavy internet connection to function, readme file in multiple languages, intuitive design doesn’t require much text, doesn’t require high computing power.

* * → we need to create a list 
  * Add lists to inclusive design
  * 
* Can I receive a mobile data grant to attend a conference?
  * Wikimedia rapid grants?
  * World wide web
  * Sadilar 
* What ethical tools can I use?
  * Ethicalresources.net 
* How do I design a virtual/physical event to be inclusive? // How do I ensure diversity in my event?
  * Carpentries
  * Alan turing
  * 
* Where can I find other groups/information about diversity in tech? In open science?
  * Awesome list
  *
