# The Survey!

To gain insight of the current computational landscape in different environments, we aim to launch a survey to **assess the needs and requirements of individuals from different backgrounds** by covering the following topics:

* 🛠 Which tools are used by researchers at different data life-cycle

  i.e. Planning, Creation/collection of data, Analysis, Sharing, Preservation.

* 🛠 Which tools are used by researchers in aid of improving computational inclusion such as those used in capacity building and training.
* 🛠 Which tools are used by researchers in community building and outreach. 
* 📎 Which computational tools do you need? What would you like to see developed?

Our vision is to create a valuable resource where we can offer:

* A space for knowledge-sharing, advice, good practices, workflows, and a list of tools to facilitate computational training and research data management.
* Guidelines and lessons learned from LMICs \(low and middle-income countries\).
* Ideas for the development of accessible, adaptable technical solutions.
* A community space for diverse open data and open research enthusiasts to connect and collaborate.
