# Quick guide

#### I want to analyse my data but the software only works on specific platforms, what are the alternatives? // My institute cannot afford the license, any open source alternatives? // This website/tool is not available in my country, are there any alternatives? 

{% hint style="info" %}
* If you are struggling to find alternatives that work on your platform, please [check our list of tools available](https://selgebali.gitbook.io/opencider/advice-and-tools/checklists-and-info/tools-and-computational-infrastructure).
* [Tools Available For Researchers](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/preservation-tools-techniques-and-policies/wiki/tools-available-researchers-0)
* [Awesome Research Tools](https://github.com/emptymalei/awesome-research)
* If the software was written for another Operating System \(OS\), you may be able to use an emulator. For example, Windows programs often run under Linux using Wine.
